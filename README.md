# Macropad SSE server

This Spring microservice is the connection part of my open source project called "Ninja-Macropad".
It allows to notify devices about actions.

During free time I will make some docs about this project to make it usable for
those who want to increase productivity level with me.

## Configuration

It's recommended to use at least HTTPS encryption to prevent plain text communication with server.
We don't want anybody else to execute commands on our machine, right? :)

## Roadmap

In the future, I want to add some additional features to this project. There's a shortly described list:
- ~~remove event queue [MP-ES-F-01]~~,
- ~~device id is PC hostname [MP-ES-F-02]~~,
- ~~endpoint for getting list of available devices [MP-ES-F-03]~~.
